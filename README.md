# SVG Logo Maker


## Description

The purpose of this application was to create an SVG logo maker. This enables the user to quickly generate an SVG logo after providing user input. The user now has more time to work on their projects since they don't have to spend as much time developing their SVG logo. By creating this application I was able to gain more insight into developing an SVG file and the different shapes and features that could be created.

## Usage

This application can be used by using node index.js to start the inquirer npm which will ask the user for their input. The user is prompted for the text, text color, shape, and shape color that they want for the SVG logo. Once all the information has been inputted, then an SVG file is created with the information for their logo. The user is then able to open the file in a browser to view the image of their SVG.

## Tests

A test was written for this application in order to test the shape classes for the render method. The test can be ran by using the npx jest command.
